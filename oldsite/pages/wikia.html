          <h2>Wikia</h2>
          <!-- <h3>Redesigning a platform for 100 million users.</h3> -->
          <p class="intro">Wikia is a wiki based web platform that is heavily focussed on user retention. To do this, usability across the platform needed to increase and importance was placed on expanding brand awareness. The company invested in a major redesign and established multidisciplinary teams to tackle user-focused issues. I acted as the design lead for contributions and connections on this important initiative.</p>

          <div class="small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 columns">
            <h3>Messaging</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row two-col">
          <div class="small-12  medium-10 medium-offset-1     columns">
            <p>Upon joining Wikia, my first task was to help rethink user notifications and messaging. To elaborate on the challenges of this problem, I first have to explain how the platform works:</p>
            <p>Wikia is a collection of communities each focusing on various topics. The most common communities focus on video games, tv shows, and movies. Each community has a wiki (an online encyclopedia) at its core, along with various other tools (forums, community walls, custom pages) to help the communities thrive. A registered user can subscribe to any wiki and will then receive notifications such as: edits, replies to posts, private messages, and community announcements. The complicated bit of all of this is that a registered user can subscribe to multiple wikis.</p>
            <p>The implementation when I joined Wikia looked like this:</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="small-12 columns">
            <div class="flex-video twobyone">
              <video    loop autoplay muted poster="../assets/images/covers/messaging.png">
                <source src="../assets/videos/wikia/messaging.mp4" type="video/mp4">
              </video>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row two-col">
          <div class="small-12  medium-10 medium-offset-1     columns">
            <p>There are a number of problems with this implementation, but these are a few worth mentioning: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The view is optimized for desktop with no thought to mobile users</li>
              <li>There is no easy way to scan all of your new messages to see which are important</li>
              <li>It is visually inconsistent with the rest of the platform</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Working with a team of engineers and a product manager, we addressed major issues with the implementation and proposed the following solution that ultimately performed better in user testing:</p>

            <p>After working on Wikia’s messaging system, a live style guide, a WYSIWYG editor, and a couple other projects, I had become part of an amazing group of co-collaborators. Although we were all on different teams across the company, there were six forward-thinkers that really wanted to help push the platform forward. We were hungry for a more beautiful, user friendly, and fast-to-iterate platform for our users, so we took matters into our own hands.</p>
            <p>Over drinks in SOMA, the six of us discussed how we could improve not just the platform, but the culture at Wikia as well. How could we help make the company a place where people weren’t afraid to take risks, to use both qualitative and quantitative data to help inform decisions, and to passionately care about the 100 million people that visited our site monthly?</p>
            <p>We continued this conversation for a couple weeks until one of us said, “Why don’t we just build it, and show Wikia what can  really be done? Why don’t we put our money where our mouth is?” And that was the start of the Beautiful Wikia project. In our spare time, we would get together and work on what could potentially be the future of Wikia if we kept our core values and business model, but started from the ground up.</p>
            <p>We unveiled our fully functioning prototype to the company in early 2014 during an all-hands meeting and the reaction was overwhelmingly positive. The six of us looked at each other and instantly knew that our hard work had payed off. We had started a conversation. </p>

            <p>Wikia has 130 million monthly uniques, 34 million pages, and 60% of traffic is mobile. One of the engineers, Ken Kouot, created a mobile team based off the work we did for Beautiful Wikia. Their project was recently released to the public, outperforming the old mobile layout on every front. The company is on the upswing and the future is only getting brighter for them. I am forever grateful to have been a part of that amazing team.</p>
