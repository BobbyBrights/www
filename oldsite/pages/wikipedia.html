          <!-- <h3>Redesigning a platform for 100 million users.</h3> -->
          <p class="intro">In 2011, a joint effort to look toward the future of contributing on MediaWiki platforms was established by the Wikimedia Foundation and Wikia. This rich-text editor is the first true WYSIWYG editor that has been enabled across all of Wikipedia.</p>

            <p>When I joined the project, the engineers and product team had been in full swing for the better part of two years. Up until this point, the team had been focussed primarily on the performance and software architecture of the Visual Editor. As impressive as their work was, I couldn’t help but feel as though the users had been left out of the equation. </p>
            <p>I worked with the Visual Editor team to establish a user testing program to aid in the interaction design work I would be doing. Because user testing was relatively new for both Wikia and Wikipedia, the Wikia product manager, Trevor Bolliger, and I decided on a guerrilla approach to the testing. We would purchase gift cards and go out to parks and malls and have informal user testing surveys. We would open with a questionnaire to gain insight on familiarity with various competing products and some base demographics. Depending on what we were testing in the session, the next steps would either be to familiarize the tester with Wikia/Wikipedia or to dive in and have them perform tasks. Trevor and I would take notes and record the users actions on screen, then form a summary along with a summary, including a collection of video, for the rest of the team or review. This is a sped up clip from one of the sessions where we were testing a proposed gallery solution using a rough prototype:</p>

            <p>Using this data along with the qualitative data from our analytics team we were able to quickly form hypotheses, test, and iterate to help move the Visual Editor along quickly. The editor is now live on Wikipedia for all logged-in users and on Wikia for all unregistered users.</p>
