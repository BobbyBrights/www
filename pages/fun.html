          <h1>Creating a Fun Workplace</h1>
          <h3 style="">When I joined DigitalOcean culture was one of the biggest deciding factors for me. There had to be a group of people that I could laugh with as well as grow with. In my time here, I’ve done everything in my power to not only help the team grow as individuals but also grow as a team.</h3>

          <p><b>Pushing Us Closer</b></p>
            <p>When on a team, it’s easy to get caught in the trap of only talking about the projects you are working and what you did that past weekend, without actually getting to know one another. It takes a while for people to warm up to one another and it’s rare that you chat about things like: “What was your childhood like?” “What’re five of your favorite songs?” or “If you could travel anywhere, where would you go and why?” These kind of questions are both fun and revealing. You start to understand what drives each person, and rather than just teammates you quickly start forming the bond as friends. </p>
            <p>In the initial few months working at DigitalOcean I started sending out questionnaires to various members of the design team and then would compile those questions into a weekly roundup. These helped bolster conversation in the group, and allowed us to grow closer as a team in quick fashion.</p>

          <p><b>An Unfortunate Opportunity</b><br/></p>
          
            <p>Our design team went from one team doing all things design related to the more standard split for a technology company where you have marketing design on one side of the house and product design on the other. Joel Califa stepped up to lead the product design team and Scott Alden led the brand design team, with Jesse Chase maintaining his role as Creative Director. After two years on the job, Jesse decided that it was time to leave DigitalOcean, and a few month later Scott also decided to leave for another opportunity. Both were big losses to the team, not just because of their amazing work ethic but also because of their wonderful personalities. In the wake of the moving, Joel pulled me aside and asked me, “Would you be interested into stepping into Scott’s role to lead the brand design team?”</p>
            <p>This was an amazing albeit and unfortunate opportunity. I was a product designer by trade, but the team needed someone to step into the role. I jumped in head first and tried my best to help the team grow and be better versions of themselves. Through many one-on-ones and group conversations, I found what I believed to be a few of the major issues our team was facing. Over the following months we worked together to slowly fix the issues, whilst also woking to launch a new brand and a new website.</p>

          <p><b>Launching New Branding and a New Website</b><br/>
            <p>Despite what is said after a logo launch, the process is anything but clean and straightforward. We started our rebrand process a year and a half before officially launching our new brand. We worked with a couple phenomenal agencies to come up with updated branding, but many factors led to us not deciding to use any of the options presented. Kasia Bojanowska took on the logo when we brought the process in house. She spent many months speaking to users, and getting feedback on different iterations of the mark. While this was happening Masami Kubo was taking on the role of redesigning our website to match our updated branding. </p>
            <p>Because of the many areas that the new branding and website would affect there was a lot of discussion back and forth about what we were launching and how to launch it. At times there seemed to be no light at the end of the tunnel, but together we pushed through and managed to launch our new branding and website. </p>

            <p>I fundamentally believe that for a team to be high-performing, you have to have diverse background, and know and trust one another. Without that diversity and trust, a team can falter when pushed hard. Our team came together in a very trying time to create something that represents something larger than just the sum of its parts and I couldn’t be more proud of everyone involved.</p>
