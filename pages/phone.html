          <p><b>Problem</b></p>
            <p>During Hurricane Isaac, Oliver Farshi and I were sitting in a friend’s living room discussing the limited access to important information in these difficult times. We were incredibly fortunate to be able to openly discuss these problems and knowing that we had enough food and water to last through the five-day power outage. Many others weren’t afforded that luxury, and that’s where we realized we might be able to help.</p>

          <!-- <p><b>User Testing</b><br/></p> -->
          
            <p>During disasters like Isaac many public services fail, but often the National Guard and other organizations are able to provide food, water, and other vitally important necessities to people in need. Unfortunately it’s often hard to  find out where these stations are located or if there are any other important callouts happening in the area, such as a boil water advisory. </p><br/>

          <p><b>Solution</b></p>
            
            <p>While most of the standard public services falter during storms of this magnitude, the one under-utilized service that usually stays together longest are phone lines. The landline penetration in low income neighborhoods – those that are likely to be disproportionately affected by disasters – was extremely high at the time. Oliver and I partnered up to make 60 Second Scoop – A Twilio powered application that would read the latest updated from a Twitter feed that was already active with the updates that would be most useful in these situations. </p>
